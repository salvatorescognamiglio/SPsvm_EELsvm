Please see sample_script.m for a sample implementation of the Single Perturbation (SP) SVM and the Extreme Empirical Loss (EEL) SVM on the sample dataset in statlog.csv. 

The following are the files available:
1.	SPsvmtrain.m - This function implements the SP SVM formulation (dual) for binary classification.
2.	EELsvmtrain.m - This function implements the EEL SVM formulation (dual) for binary classification.
3.	EELsvmtune.m - This function can be used to tuning parameters of EEL-SVM with RBF kernel. It uses grid search for tuning.
4.	SPsvmtune.m - This function can be used to tuning parameters of SP-SVM with RBF kernel. It uses grid search for tuning.
5.	ker.m - This function computes linear or Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.
6.	statlog.csv - Sample dataset
7.	sample_script.m  Sample code for running the SP and EEL SVMs with RBF kernels on statlog dataset.
